# Zero Tax Devs

## About Me

Welcome to Zero Tax Devs! I run [Zero Tax Jobs](https://zerotaxjobs.com); a job site for software engineers seeking work in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.

## About This Project

Zero Tax Devs is a project to visualize trends in the software developer job data posted on my Zero Tax Jobs site. The data is currently restricted to last month's data and currently focuses on the most requested skills on job listings in the region, but I'll be adding new analyses in the future.

## Support This Project

This is a work in progress, and I'll add more data if I have time. I do this for free in my spare time. If you'd like to support my work, feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zerotaxjobs)!

You are also welcome to contribute to my public GitHub repository. You can suggest changes, report issues, or leave a üëç on something you support.

## Using The Data

You're welcome to use the data as long as you give attribution in the form of written credit to Zero Tax Jobs with a do-follow backlink pointing to [https://zerotaxjobs.com](https://zerotaxjobs.com) alongside the data.
